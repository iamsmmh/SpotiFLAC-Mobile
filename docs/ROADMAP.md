provider-id map, duplicate merging — the "ONE TRACK" backbone

## 25. Privacy
✅ no account, local-only data, logging toggle · 🚀 stats opt-out, savepoint opt-out ✅ history clearing UI wiring (clear restore memory + reset statistics)

## 26. Sleep timer
🚀 15/30/45/60 + end-of-track + stop, in the glass player

## 27. Network management
